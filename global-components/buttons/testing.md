# Testing

Here are the things that need to be tested when it comes to A11y: 

* Can the button be reached with the `TAB` key only?
* Can the button be triggered by pressing the `ENTER` or `RETURN`key?
* Is there a machine-readable label \(not the element\) on the button? I.e., the button has text content, or the button contains an `<img>` with `alt` text
* In high-contrast mode, is the button still discernible?
