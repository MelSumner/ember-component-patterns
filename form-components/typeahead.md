# Typeahead

### Introduction

The typeahead or combobox component is usually similar to a textbox where users can type ahead to select an option, or sometimes even type arbitrary text as a new item to add to the list. 

It is a combination of a single line input field with a listbox popup. Because this field is editable and is typically used for autocomplete behavior \(to help the user find things more quickly\), the `aria-autocomplete` attribute should be used.
