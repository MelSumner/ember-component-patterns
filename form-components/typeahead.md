# Typeahead

### Introduction

The typeahead or combobox component is usually similar to a textbox where users can type ahead to select an option, or sometimes even type arbitrary text as a new item to add to the list. 

It is a combination of a single line input field with a listbox popup. Because this field is editable and is typically used for autocomplete behavior \(to help the user find things more quickly\), the `aria-autocomplete` attribute should be used. 

#### Keyboard Interactions

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `UP`/`DOWN`  | cycle through the auto-suggestions and input field |
| `ESC` | close the listbox \(if open\) |
| `ENTER` | select the currently focused auto-suggestion item and close the listbox |
| `TAB` | select the currently focused auto-suggestion, close the menu, and move focus to the next focusable element |
