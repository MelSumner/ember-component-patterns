# Styling: Pagination

It becomes easier to provide styling for pagination components if correct markup is used. 

Considering the markup given on the previous page, a few style considerations can then be listed: 

1. the item marked with the `aria-current` attribute should have a visually distinctive look from the other pagination items
2. hover and focus states should be considered, including the active indicator
3. disabled elements should be distinctly disabled \(`cursor: not-allowed`is one helpful indication\)
