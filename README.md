# Ember Component Patterns

The goal of this guide is to cultivate a set of patterns that are practical and can reasonably be used by any Ember developer in their application. 

The component patterns here will, at least initially, be completely without any CSS styling. This is to help clearly delineate form and function. "First, make it useful; then make it beautiful" as the saying goes. 

As this project matures, more prose will be added that will explain why other options were not chosen, providing both a well-lit path and a knowledge base for the shadows. 

### Developers

* write more technically accurate code 
* worry a little bit less about writing code that is not accessible
* have easy-to-reference base requirements for common component patterns

### Designers

* understand what components really need to have from a functional perspective
* helps you ensure that your beautiful designs will include the necessary functionality

### BAs & TPMs

* reference to help you more accurately know component base requirements
* helps you to plan out projects more accurately
