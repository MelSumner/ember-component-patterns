# Ember Component Patterns

The goal of this guide is to cultivate a set of patterns that are practical and can reasonably be used by any Ember developer in their application. It is intended to be made publicly available with the [preview release of Ember Octane](https://emberjs.com/editions/octane/).

The component patterns here will, at least initially, be without CSS styling. This is to help clearly delineate form and function. "First, make it useful; then make it beautiful" as the saying goes. When necessary to demonstrate the validity of the approach, however, a sub-section on styling may be added to the pattern if it helps to demonstrate what might otherwise be thought of as impossible.

As this project matures, the [anti-patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern) will be explored by adding more prose and explains to demonstrate why other options were not chosen, providing both a well-lit path for success and a knowledge base for the shadows.

What one can obtain from this collection of patterns depends on the reader; however a few potential types of readers, and possible goals, have been kept in mind. Some examples:

## For Developers

* write more technically accurate code 
* worry a little bit less about writing code that is not accessible
* have easy-to-reference base requirements for common component patterns
* have confidence in the code you produce

## For Designers

* understand what components really need to have from a functional perspective
* ensure that designs will include the necessary functionality and accessibility
* focus on design within clear technical constraints

## For BAs & TPMs

* reference to help you more accurately know base requirements for the new feature\(s\) you want to add to your project
* confidently plan out projects more accurately by reducing "unknown unknowns"
